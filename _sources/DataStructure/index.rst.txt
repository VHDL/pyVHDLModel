Data Structures
###############

Besides the document object model as a tree-like structure, pyVHDLModel has either lists, lookup dictionaries, direct
cross-references or dedicated data structure (tree, graph, â€¦) for connecting multiple objects together.

Graphs
******

pyVHDLModel uses the graph implementation from :py:mod:`pyTooling.Graph` as it provides an object oriented programming
interface to vertices and edges.

Dependency Graph
================

The dependency graph describes dependencies between:

* Sourcecode files
* VHDL libraries
* Contexts
* Packages
* Entities
* Architectures
* Packages
* Package Bodies
* Configurations

The relation can be:

* defined in source file
* references
* implements
* instantiates
* needs to be analyzed before


Hierarchy Graph
===============

The hierarchy graph can be derived from dependency graph by:

#. copying all entity and architecture vertices
#. copying all implements dependency edges
#. copying all instantiates edges in reverse direction

The graph can then be scanned for a root vertices (no inbound edges). If only a single root vertex exists, this vertex
references the toplevel of the design.


Compile Order Graph
===================

The compile order can be derived from dependency graph by:

#. copying all document vertices
#. iterating all edges in the dependency graph:

   #. resolve the source and the destination to the referenced design units
   #. resolved further to the documents these design units are declared in
   #. resolve further which vertices correspond in the compile order graph
   #. if edges does not yet exist, add an edge between two documents in the compile order graph
